/**
In this question, you are to create a DTD for a small XML data set 
drawn from the Stanford course catalog. There are multiple departments,
each with a department chair, some courses, and professors and/or
lecturers who teach courses. The XML data is here. 

Write a DTD for the XML data set. 

Important: Do not include <!DOCTYPE Course_Catalog [...]> in your DTD.
 Your DTD should start with <!ELEMENT Course_Catalog (Department*)>.

In this question, you are to create a DTD for a different version of the data
set drawn from the Stanford course catalog. This version encodes the data using ID
and IDREF(S) attributes. The XML data is here. 

Write a DTD for the XML data set. 

Hint: You may want to use your DTD from the previous question as a starting point,
since the structure is similar. 

Important: Do not include <!DOCTYPE Course_Catalog [...]> in your DTD.
Your DTD should start with <!ELEMENT Course_Catalog (Department*)>.

In this question, you are to create a DTD for a small XML data set about world countries.
This data is adapted from the Mondial 3.0 database as hosted by the University of Washington,
and was originally compiled by the Georg-August University of Goettingen Institute for Informatics.
Each country has a name, population, and area (in sq. km). Some countries also list languages 
(with percentages of the population that speaks each language) and/or cities (with names and populations).
 The XML data is here. 

Write a DTD for the XML data set. 

Important: Do not include <!DOCTYPE countries [...]> in your DTD.
 Your DTD should start with <!ELEMENT countries (country*)>.
